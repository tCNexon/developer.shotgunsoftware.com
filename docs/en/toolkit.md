# Pipeline Integrations

Shotgun includes integrations that bring the Shotgun experience into the creative tools artists use every day. Out of the box, you get plugin within artistsâ€™ tools that give you the foundation for a basic publish pipeline.

These integrations are built on the Toolkit platform, a set of APIs, UIs, and configurations that give studios the tools to build custom workflows.
